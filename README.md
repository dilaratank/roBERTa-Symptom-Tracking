# BioBert-Symptom-Tracking
Using BioBert symptom tracking (using NER) to find out what are the most common symptoms before and after COVID-19 in medical interviews.

This is a project for the course 'Natural Language and Dialogue Processing' in the bachelor Artificial Intelligence (University of Amsterdam). 

## Data
I will be using the following datasets:
- COVID-19 Dialogue Datase (during/after covid) https://www.kaggle.com/xuehaihe/covid-dialogue-dataset?select=COVID-Dialogue-Dataset-English.txt
- MedDialog Dataset (English) (before covid)  https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/Medical-Dialogue-System

## Pipeline
- Use a pre-trained BioBert on data and show results
