"Hi doctor,"
I am a 26 year old male.
I am 5 feet and 9 inches tall and weigh 255 pounds.
"When I eat spicy food, I poop blood."
"Sometimes when I have constipation as well, I poop a little bit of blood."
I am really scared that I have colon cancer.
I do have diarrhea often.
I do not have a family history of colon cancer.
I got blood tests done last night.
Please find my reports attached.
Hello.
I have gone through your information and test reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

"Hello doctor,"
I am 48 years old.
I am experiencing weak erection and difficulty in sustaining the same.
This condition was observed 10 years back.
"Also, there is premature ejaculation."
"Other physical ailments that I have are, I am suffering from hypertension and taking Amlopres-L (Amlodipine and Lisinopril) for the last 10 years, high cholesterol and triglycerides."
My cholesterol level is 225 and triglyceride is 200 for the last 12 years.
I used to do frequent masturbation in early age.
"I do have erection during morning hours many times, particularly after sound sleep or if I had long walk previous day."
"I am having Sildenafil 25 mg or 5 mg Cialis, which is effective enough."
"But, I wish to get rid of tablet support and live natural way."
I consulted urologist today and he prescribed me Nano-Leo capsules and Modula 5 mg for 10 days.
I wish to have your second opinion on this.
Please guide.
For further doubts consult a sexologist online --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/sexologist
I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).
"Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days)."
I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods.
Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan.
"But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged."
Kindly suggest me what I can do further.
I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy.
I have gallstones as well.
I just read your query.
See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea.
"As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary."
"Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception."
But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.
Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist.
"For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally."
Medicine is not of much help.
During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.
Is it a wrong way of doing?
I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate.
"Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement."
"Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract."
"Before circumcision too, I have the same problem."
Please help.

I am a 22-year-old female who often suffers constipation to the point where I feel like I get minor external hemorrhoids that often bleed.
"Again, I have not got doctor verification for this but that is what I think."
"Recently, I have been experiencing pain around the left side of my stomach."
I cannot localize it.
"Sometimes I feel like it is on my back, sometimes the lateral side, and sometimes the front."
It usually happens after I eat or pass a stool but I have a minor sensation of discomfort even when I am just sitting.
All of this has been getting a lot worse the past couple of days.
I often feel nauseated too.
"I think I may have diverticulitis, however, I am not sure how common it is for my age."
I also feel like I have a small localized swelling on the LUQ that hurts when I press on it.
I am not sure what is wrong and I really want to go get some tests done but I do not feel safe going to a hospital with certain circumstances.
I think you are overthinking about your symptoms.
To be conscious is good but to be over conscious may fall in the category of anxiety and is not good.
I will advise you to be relaxed.
"Based on your symptoms, I do not feel anything to be worried of."
Considering your age and symptoms of constipation and feeling something more probably pointing towards hemorrhoids or some local pathology.
But physical examination and maybe flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate to confirm underlying pathology or maybe online video consultation with gastroenterologist if you are worried about going to the hospital.
I will advise you following general measures to follow that will help you.
1) Try to relax.
Do not overthink.
There is nothing serious we are thinking of.
2) Take fibers.
Increase it in the diet in the form of vegetables.
Add Ispagol in your diet.
3) Avoid constipation.
4) Take plenty of water.
"5) Do regular walk, exercise inside your home if you can not go outside."
6) Do not strain in the restroom.
7) Take a sitz bath daily.
Follow me in case you got further queries.
I am 27 years old.
"My weight is 48 kg, and height is 5.8 feet."
I am a pure vegetarian.
I need to increase my body weight.
I am suffering from psychological problems like anxiety.
"I am not diabetic, BP is normal."
I do not smoke and drink.
"Please suggest foods to increase weight, immunity, and fertility."
Kindly advise.
How is your eating habits?
Your total calorie intake should be around 2200 cal/day.
This will include all three meals with a snack in the evening.
You can drink any protein supplements at that time.
Include ghee two to three teaspoons a day.
Cheese or paneer weekly thrice.
Exercise every day for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
Simplest is brisk walking.
Your appetite will increase with exercises.
All fruits and vegetables are allowed.
"Take milkshakes, lassi, protein supplements after your exercise."
All kinds of dals and whole pulses are allowed.
Whenever you are eating high protein diet follow that by light food.
"For example, if you are eating channa for breakfast, eat a light lunch."
Gradually increase your intake.
"If you follow my diet, definitely your immune system will become good."
Weight gain will happen slowly.
Meditation is good for psychological problems.
Concentrate on positive things in life.
Do not worry too much about your weight.
"If your overall health is good, it is a very positive sign for you."
Follow up after two weeks.
I am a 39-year-old woman.
I have mild pain in the left side of the chest (below the neck and above the breast) and then sensation in the upper back from four days.
It comes and goes.
Sometimes it goes to the right side of the chest also.
I have done my ECG and blood test 6 months ago.
ECG and blood sugar were normal.
No hypertension but hemoglobin was 10 and Vitamin B 12 was below average.
What can I do as in lockdown it is not possible to see the doctor as a person.
"I would like to ask you some more questions, do you have symptoms of acid peptic disease or GERD?"
"Or any burning sensation in the epigastric region, the center of your chest (heartburn)."
"If you do, it could also present as chest pain so I will guide you accordingly."
"I would also like to rule out any muscular pain, for which I will encourage you to take a muscle relaxant and see if it helps."
Take tablet Muscoril (Thiocholchicoside 4 mg) one tablet once a day when you experience pain and let me know in the follow up in a couple of days to see if it relieves the pain.
"Like you said your Vitamin B12 levels are below normal, it could also be neuropathic pain for which I will only advise vitamin B12 supplements (tablet Methycolbalmine once a day for three months) or B complex supplements."
You can also improve these levels with diet.
"Take diet enriched with beef, liver, and chicken."
"Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams."
Fortified breakfast cereal.
"Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs."
"Since your Hb is also below the ideal levels, take iron-rich foods which are usually Vitamin B12 rich as well."
So I will advise diet modification to incorporate these in your everyday routine or take supplements with iron and Vitamin B12 as well.
Because anemia can also present with the said symptoms.
"Lastly, I will encourage you to reduce weight with exercise and changing your diet and switching to a low-fat diet with the addition of more fruits and vegetables to your diet."
Try to start with atleast 30-40 minutes of cardio workout every day and work it up from there according to your stamina and you will see the visible change that you feel.
You will feel more active and fresh.
Try to bring your BMI (body mass index) as close to the normal range as you can.
Because obesity itself can cause countless problems as well.
I hope this helps.
ECG (electrocardiography).
Do not lift heavyweights.
"Take low fat, high fiber diet."

I am a 39-year-old male.
I am 168 cm in height and 68 kg in weight.
"Since last one month, I have been suffering from intermittent loose motions (yellow colored)."
"There is no vomiting, no fever, or major abdominal pain (except for occasional cramps)."
"Initially, I took a combination of Norfloxacin and Tinidazole for four days, but things did not improve."
Thereafter on the prescription of my doctor I took Metronidazole 400 and Dicyclomine 20 mg for a period of 14 days.
I also took Lactobacillus tablets for the entire period.
"During these times I only ate poha, rice, curd, and banana."
"Also, I took boiled water."
It is the fifth day now and I have discontinued the medicines.
"Despite on such a bland diet (no wheat), I still have at least one to two loose motions in a day."
My routine medical tests were done in January this year which was normal.
My wife and son also developed loose motion in between for a very brief period.
"However, they recovered fully within three days."
Please advice.
I cannot see any red flags in your symptoms.
More likely nothing to worry.
It is the function of your intestines that is triggered by some infection and you are facing overactive intestine.
More likely it is a functional problem unless proven otherwise.

I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12.
"Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same."
There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict.
"I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better."
What can I do?
"I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl."
You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem.
Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good.
"As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight."
"My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life."
"Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism."
"Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward."
Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour.
"If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking."
"Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking."

"Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone)."
Organ meats need to be avoided.
Is your menstrual cycle normal?
Please get back if you have any other complaints.
Follow up after 15 days.
I am a 13-year-old male and I have had semen leakage for about three months.
"I think it is from weak nerves because last year, I would masturbate a lot but then I stopped because it was becoming painful and I was embarrassed."
"Then about three months ago, I watched something inappropriate and I ejaculated without doing anything."
"Then a week later, I started to have semen leakage every day about three to four times a day."
I am just very worried and I just want this to be cured and go away.
"Also, could this affect my eyes in any way?"
Let me tell you that the symptoms described by you suggest that you have a nightfall problem.
The high quality way to deal with dusk is the use of herbal or selfmade remedies.
There are no aspect outcomes for such remedy methods.
You ought to have yogurt at least two or three bowls a day.
Avoid looking at porn as plenty of porn arouses you sexually.
So it is recommended now not to watch porn.
Sage tea – having two cups of sage tea a day will limit the probabilities of nocturnal emission.
Gooseberry – popularly recognized as amla acts as an anti-oxidant and helps in lowering the nightfall.
Gradually the moist goals trouble will be solved.
Bathing – it is a recommendation to take bathtub earlier than you go to bed.
It helps you have a sound sleep.
A sound sleep is very vital for averting nightfall.
I was diagnosed with PCOS in January so my gynecologist prescribed me Ginette 35 for six months and Bonemac D3 for one month.
But from March my periods are regular without taking medicines but there is sometimes slight pain in my lower abdomen and side abdomen.
Should I continue medicines despite having normal and regular periods?
"If you are having regular periods in terms of flow, duration and regularities and if you have already stopped taking Ginette since March, there is no need to resume its intake immediately unless you need contraception also at the same time or not wanting a pregnancy now."
"In that case, you need to use an alternative mode of contraception to avoid your pregnancy."
Please attach your previous prescriptions blood test and ultrasound scan reports based upon which PCOS was diagnosed.
"Also, inform your height weight and whether there is excessive hair in the chin, upper lip, chest, and abdomen Follow up with reports again."
"Also, follow the lifestyle modifications described below."
Blood for serum fasting insulin levels.
Blood for serum vitamin D3 levels.
USG (ultrasound) TVS (transvaginal scan) if not done in the past three months.
Continue vitamin D. Avoid junk food spicy and dip fried foods.
"Low carbohydrates, fat restricted, gluten-free diet is recommended."
Regular brisk cardio excercise like walking jogging cycling swimming for at least 30 minutes a day is a must.
Take frequent small meals.
I am 16 years old.
I just recently discovered that I have scoliosis.
I do not know much about it but I will tell you what I know.
"My scoliosis currently has only a 3-degree curve and I am pretty confident it is a C shaped curve, although I am not sure."
What do you think are the chances that my scoliosis will develop into adulthood?
Do you think it will stop progressing once I am fully grown?
"Before going into the progress of scoliosis, I would like to make you some clarity about the facts on it."
1) The Cobb angle is a measure of the curvature of the spine in degrees.
This helps to determine what type of treatment is necessary.
A Cobb angle of 10 degrees is regarded as a minimum angulation to define scoliosis.
2) A scoliosis curve of 10 to 15 degrees normally does not require any treatment except for regular check-ups.
"3) If the scoliosis curve is 20 to 40 degrees, the orthopedic doctor will prescribe a back brace help to keep the spine from developing more of a curve."
4) More than 45 degrees need correction surgery keeping many pedicle screw and osteotomy to correct the curve.
I hope you go for x ray done of your spine and it will be easy to measure properly about the curvature.
I have a 2.5-month-old who I recently noticed developed a tongue tremor.
I looked up online for the causes and found them as SMA.
"She has great motor control, we were not doing tummy time as often because she did not like it but have increased it and have seen a big improvement."
"My doctor believes it is benign tongue tremor, unfortunately, we had a telehealth appointment due to COVID so he was unable to see her but he told me not to worry and to keep an eye if things get worse."
"I am so scared it is SMA, what else should I be looking for?"
"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com."
"History noted as above, your 2.5-month-old has developed tongue tremors."
"Please provide me more detailed history such as preterm or full term, birth weight, normal delivery or LSCS."
How is her weight?
Is she gaining weight and let me know more about family history or any other in the family suffering from SMA (spinal muscular atrophy).
SMA is confirmed only by Genetic testing or by muscle study.
There are many types of SMA some of them develop symptoms later in life and a few develop in early life.
Keep a watch on her development like head holds muscle tone and power and let me know me know if tongue fasciculation increases and the child becomes more hypotonic.
Why my ortho does not put brackets in power chains while missing one or two spots?
I have straight teeth and I am in the sixth year with braces.
"I think instead of closing gaps, this is creating gaps."
There are different types of power chains that are available for the treatment depending on the interlink space.
1
Short (connects every alternate bracket).
2
Long (connects every third bracket).
3
Closed (connects each bracket).
"So depending on the stage of your treatment, either of the types can be used which may or may not connect individual brackets."
"Also, we would require the history of the type of malocclusion you had in the first place as the duration of the treatment varies with the complexity of the malocclusion."
Complex malocclusion which require a lot of rotations and closure of gaps may take longer than usual.
"Also, the density of your alveolar bone and your body's bone remodeling rate affects the duration of final results."
"So in order to give a definitive diagnosis, we would require your treatment history which includes - 1."
Preoperative and post-operative clinic photographs (intraoral and extraoral both).
Preoperative dental x-rays (OPG and lateral cephalogram).
"Treatment history including the types of malocclusion, brackets used, wires used and the movements caused."
4
Oral hygiene maintenance routine that you follow during the braces treatment.
Waiting for your reply.
Brush twice daily with flouride containing paste.
Use of salt water gargles everyday especially after meals.Tongue cleaning on regular basis.
A periodic check up with your dentist once every 6 months.
A visit to the dentist for oral prophylaxis (teeth cleaning and polishing) once every six months.
After providing the required information.
I am a 60-year-old male who just received the results of a 24-hour Holter monitor.
Key findings include:
Sinus rhythm with frequent supraventricular ectopy (2559) which included couplets and one seven beat SVE multiplet.
No complex forms.
No significant pauses or periods of heart block noted.
Constant feeling of missed beats coincides with frequent supraventricular ectopy.
Very infrequent ventricular ectopy that was isolated and univocal.
"Cardiologists not concerned with findings and recommended positive affirmation, distraction, and cognitive behavioral strategies."
He was very reluctant to recommend anti-arrhythmic treatment seeing this as overkill.
Other matters of interest.
Recent stress echo (March) indicated above average fitness for age (14 mets) and reached a maximum heart rate of 160 bpm.
"Moderate aortic regurgitation (grade 3-4), normal ejection fraction (60), LVEDV (138 mls), no demonstrable ischemia or arrhythmia."
The recent PACs are very noticeable and I feel every one of them.
I would appreciate a second opinion or advice on whether there is anything else I can do to stop them.
"I am currently on Atenolol 100 mg, Crestor 40 mg, Effexor 74 mg, and Valium 5 mg."
Premature atrial contractions or supraventricular ectopics are not harmful per se other than giving you symptoms.
"So antiarrhythmics are not usually recommended, so I do not disagree with your treating cardiologist."
"Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics."
So trying behavioral techniques is a good option.
"But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped."
"Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects."
"However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation."
You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help.
"You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc."
"Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested."
"So in a nutshell, antiarrhythmics may be avoided, but if not tolerable symptomatically then may be tried."
"This is about my 69 years old mother, non-obese, nonhypertensive, nondrinker/smoker."
She is not on any medication.
"She is unable to move her left arm for the past three days and also has shoulder pain, especially when not sitting."
There was no injury to the arm.
And the trouble moving her arms is such that she cannot even braid her hair.
Does this indicate heart disease?
Can a finger pulse oximeter reading of the affected arm be of any relevance in ruling out a cardiac issue?
What about ECG reading?
Please reply.
"Hello, Welcome to ilciniq.com."
"Please attach the ECG report, it is not attached."
"Please clarify, whether the pain is prominent feature or inability to move the arm, or is it like that she is not able to move arm because of pain or fear of pain."
"Now, this is not indicative of heart disease."
Left arm pain without chest pain is unlikely to be related to the heart.
"Also, there would not be any difficulty in moving the arm with a heart attack."
So it is unlikely to be related to the heart.
"The possibilities are, one is cervical and second is shoulder problems like frozen shoulder, or arm dislocation, even if there is no history of obvious trauma (frozen shoulder is more lifely)."
"So she will need, 1."
ECG (electrocardiography) to be sure.
X-ray of shoulder AP/lateral view and maybe cervical spine if having symptoms.
"Next, the pulse oximeter will not helpful in ruling out heart disease."
"However, if she has severe shortness of breath and low oxygen reading then this may indicate heart failure, so indirectly we may infer."
"However, if the pain is mild and weakness is prominent then it is probably either cervical issue or neurological issue."
So get her examined by local doctor and x-ray done.
You may use Volini spray or Diclofenac spray.
I am 24 years old.
"Three months ago, I got viral conjuctivitis after two weeks everything was fine but eyes got blurred then my doctor recommended me Tobramycin + Fluorometholone acetate suspension and Tear Naturale Forte."
Then after using it for one month my vision was clear but then doctor changed eye drops to Tobarest-F and Tear Naturale Forte.
Now my vision is getting blurred again.
What should I do?
"Now I have no other problem such as redness, itching, etc., just blurry vision is there."
I have seen the picture.
(attachment removed to protect patient identity).
 You are having post-viral SPK (superficial punctuate keratitis) in your eyes.
It is a very common condition after viral conjunctivitis.
It is that small whitish scar marks on the cornea which leads to blurred vision.
It will take time to resolve.
You have to continue drops which have been prescribed by your doctor that is perfect drops only.
So no need to worry.
It can take three to six months or sometimes one year to resolve.
Just continue drops which you are using right now both you should use it daily for at least a month.
Then you can taper the frequency of it and slowly you can stop it.
Slowly your vision will improve as lesions on the cornea will get resolved.
My father is 71 years old.
He having abdominal pain in the middle for the past four to five days.
Pain is constant and mild to moderate in intensity.
He is not having any issue in passing stools or urine but sometimes complains of burning sensation while passing stools.
His appetite is good.
No vomiting or diarrhea.
No fever.
His current medial history includes diabetes and hypertension.
He is an Alzheimer patient.
Can you please prescribe some medication for his abdominal pain.
I can understand you must be very upset about your father's health.
"Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines."
Common possibilities in his age are: 1.
"Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs."
This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension.
"The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others."
"The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel."
"And lastly, since he has a problem with constipation the gas accumulation can also be the reason of his abdominal pain."
"But remember, we cannot say that it is because of gas distension unless we exclude all other possibilities which are more concerning."
I suggest you to get investigations which I write below.
"Only after the investigation, we can be able to diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately."
I really hope this set of investigations will help us to approach the problem correctly.
Mesenteric ischemia.
"Pancreatitis, gall bladder or common bile duct stones."
"Colitis, colonic neoplasia."
"Gas, constipation related."
Compete blood count.
Serum amylase and lipase.
Liver function tests.
Serum lactate level and serum CRP (c-reactive protein).
HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin).
Lipid profile.
Stool for detailed report.
Stool for occult blood on consecutive three days.
Stool for fecal calprotectin.
Capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals.
Ispagol husk two tablespoons full with water daily.
Follow up after investigation.
"My symptoms are watery eyes, blocked nose, sneezing, and runny nose with transparent fluid coming out of my nose."
It gets worse when I have something from the refrigerator but I am sure it is not common cold.
What other doctors diagnosed was that I have got allergic rhinitis.
I feel fine sometimes when I take Montelukast FX but sometimes even Montelukast does not help.
This allergy starts from starting June to about September but it is hard to live with a runny nose and sneezing.
"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com."
The symptoms you have mentioned are of allergic rhinitis.
But it is just not sneezing and watering of eyes.
It causes major complications in your body starting from sinusitis to asthma which becomes permanent to your life.
We have to curb it in its initial stages.
First complete cleaning of fans in your room and also the pillow covers and bed sheet.
Use the mask as much as possible to prevent yourself from dust exposure.
Montek FX (Montelukast and Fexofenadine) just gives you symptomatic relief on that day.
You have to advance to nasal sprays and nasal washes as a permanent solution.
Advance anti-allergic drugs have to be started.
I need to know the details of allergies possible and have to remove the source.
I am in week 6 of my pregnancy and I am worried about some things that happened very early in the pregnancy before I knew I was pregnant.
I had a few glasses of wine from day 0 to day 20.
A total of six maybe and one glass and a half on day 20.
I also took corticosteroids (Betamethasone) a single dose of 3 mg due to an allergic reaction on day 20.
"And as if this was not enough, I was also on antibiotics (Flucloxacillin) which I finished on day 24 of pregnancy."
I am so afraid all of this might have had an impact on the baby.
Is there a risk my baby might have been affected?
"As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle."
Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date.
"So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period."
"So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released."
"And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby."
"Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy."
So be calm and stop worrying about the risks.
It will just increase your stress levels.
"Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine."
This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy.
"So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured."
"And more over your pregnancy has reached until 6 weeks, that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about."
Please consult your gynecologist for your antenatal checkup and investigations required to be taken as per your local protocols.
USG (ultrasound) for dating and viability.
NT (nuchal) scan with dual marker test between 11-13 weeks.
Routine antenatal investigations as per your local protocols.
Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily once after food until 13-14 weeks.
Avoid sexual intercourse until 14 weeks.
Consult your gynecologist before any medications intake or to review the medications already taking for chronic medical conditions.
I have an oily skin type.
"Recently I am experiencing pimples, white bumps, red dots on my cheeks close to my ears."
Sometimes I feel very itchy near the pimples.
I have developed one or two new big pimples on my forehead also.
When the pimple subsides after a week or two it leaves a reddish brown mark on that area.
I feel the need to wash my face very often as it starts feeling very heavy and sticky from all the oil on my face.
I used Clear Gel for some time but it is not working on my skin.
Not using any other medication at the moment.
Kindly help me with the same.
Attach a picture of the lesion for details.
Use Ahaglow face wash twice daily for 15 days.
Are there pustules?
Inflammatory red lesions?
Photosensitivity?
"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old."
It has been more than a year my liver function test result remains high.
"I have been tested for hepatitis A, B, C, E, and autoimmune hepatitis, but the result all came out negative."
My doctor told to take blood test regularly.
"But, it has been almost a year now, the result still remains high."
The lowest result so far I get is AST 90.
"But my latest liver function test result shows my AST, ALP, and GGT all 200+."
May I get any advice on this?
"I did not take any medication, consume any alcohol, but the result still came out high."
I am so worried about that.
I can imagine that you must be very concerned about your persistent elevation of the liver enzymes.
As you already have viral etiologies excluded this is time to look for other things which could lead to persistent elevation of the liver enzymes.
"Notably the Wilson, alpha, antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis type II."
"I want you to upload all your previous investigations, ultrasound reports if done, and any other testing that you have been performed in the past two years."
I also suggest you to get following blood tests which would help us excluding the above possibilities.
It is possible that you have some testing already and I do not want that you should repeat it but do upload the reports as I can see those.
"Secondly, despite you had a viral screening that showed nothing abnormal but there are certain other tests like Hb core total which can tell occult or latent infection and cause of your raised enzyme levels."
"Since the investigation may cause you significant cost it is possible alternative that you can discuss with me in detail, as we can shrink some of those testings by closely inquiring about those causes in history before getting tested."
I am sure we would reach a conclusive diagnosis by relevant information you provide and after investigations.
Wilson.
Hemochromatosis.
Autoimmune hepatitis type II.
Alpha antitrypsin deficiency.
Chronic viral hepatitis.
Complete blood count.
Liver function test (fresh) and all previous as I can see the trend
Hb core total.
"HbsAb, HbsAg."
Serum ceruloplasmin.
"Serum copper, ferritin, and transferrin saturation."
Anti LKM 1 antibody.
Serum alpha antitrypsin level.
Autoimmune or other metabolic diseases.
